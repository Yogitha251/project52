        <h3>Chameleon</h3>
    </center>
       <p>Believe it or not, there are more than a few species of chameleon out there. In fact, scientists believe there to be around 160 different types at present!
            You’ll likely find around half of them as being native to the secluded island of Madagascar, off the coast of Southern Africa. You’ll also find the critters roaming around the African mainland, as well as in Southern Europe.
            In fact, there have been movements to bring chameleons to North America, meaning that you can actually find chameleons in some Southern states, as well as Hawaii.</p>

        <h3>Cicadas</h3>
    </center>
       <p>Size and appearance. There are around 3,000 cicada species, according to National Geographic, so they vary in size from...
            Habits. Cicadas are found throughout the U.S. (and many parts of the world), but periodical cicadas — the species that...
            Diet. Though a group of these insects are called a cloud or plague, cicadas usually don't cause the harm that locusts...
            Offspring. The buzzing sound they make is a mating call. Male cicadas vibrate a white, drumlike membrane </p>

        <h3>Pandas</h3>
    </center>
        <p>Pandas can stand upright, but their short hind legs aren’t strong enough to support their bodies. 
            A panda’s bones are twice as heavy as the bones of other animals the same size.
             [5] Pandas are pigeon-toed; in other words, they walk with their front paws turned inward. [5] 
             Pandas do not run fast—a slow trot is as fast as they can go.</p>

    </center>
        <p>Pigeons are one of the first birds to be adapted to domesticity by man and have lived alongside us for centuries. 
            The pigeons we see every day are not the birds that were native to North America
             (those were made extinct long ago due to hunting practices).</p>

    </center>    
        <p>Fun Facts about Teddy Bears tell the information about a soft toy in the form of a bear. 
            In the beginning of 20th century, the collaboration between the toymakers Richard Steiff in Germany and Morris Michtom from 
            United States led into the development of Teddy Bears.</p>
